# Goodreads Demetricator

A Chrome extension removing all statistics, rankings, ratings, etc. from the book recommendation plateform Goodreads.com. The goal of this plugin is to change the way you perceive the inferface and use the website. 

This experiment was inspired by [Ben Grosser](https://bengrosser.com/) and his [Facebook Demetricator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/facebook-demetricator/dbkgglbefgkimiadfjmgnkjmaoahephg).
